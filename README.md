##### Created By: Andre Alix & 

## Introduction
Pokebuilder is a full-stack website that allows you to create, customize, and view other people's custom-built Pokemon. Using Pokebuilder
users can create their own Pokemon to their liking, choosing between their looks, types, and other essential data points found
within the original games. Each created Pokemon is fully visible within the site, allowing users to view other member's custom Pokemon and
compare them with their own. Each Pokemon is linked to a user account, allowing users to fill their page with their different creations.
Additionally, the user may use data from the official Pokemon games to help them compare and create their moves & Pokemon.
<br><br>
Any information about official Pokemon, moves, and type matchups are all taken externally from **pokeapi.co**.
